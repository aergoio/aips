# What is an AIP?

AIP stands for Aergo Improvement Proposal. An AIP is a design document providing information to the Aergo community, or describing a new feature for Aergo or its processes or environment. The AIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The AIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.
